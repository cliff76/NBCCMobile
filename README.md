New Beginnings Community Church Mobile app

This is the New Beginnings Community Church Mobile web project. It will includes both front end and 
back end modules in a single git repo. To run the front end you need:

* node/npm (preferrably [optional] yarn).
* some familiarity with using the command line.


* Install node/npm and (optional) git
* Update your system PATH to include `./node_modules/.bin` for cli tools: `export PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin`
* (Optional) Update your `~/.bashrc` for persistent cli tools: `echo "export PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin" >> ~/.bashrc`
* Install dependencies:
* run `npm install` or `yarn` from the command line
* run `npm start` or `yarn start` from the command line
